I Have Divided the Project Mainly into 3 Phases :-
1.Phase 1 -> Here we will focus on writing smart contracts where in the ZK part for now we will use a dummy verifier which always returns true but We will complete all the other things except that 
2.Phase 2 -> In this time period we will focus on completing the ZK part where we will link the verification also 
3.Phase 3-> Here We will focus on Redirecting our project with UI by making a website for our protocol 


So Lets start with the phase 1 
     ** AMM **
1. I will implement some LP tokens at first -> Done 
2. Testing of LP Tokens -> Done 
3. Set up a Factory contract and a Pair contract which will be responsible for generating pair contracts and all the swap,mint,burn ->Done
